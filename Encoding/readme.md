# Encoding
Encoding in quantum computing refers to the process of mapping classical information (data) into quantum states so that it can be processed by quantum algorithms. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), 
quantum states can represent superpositions, entanglement, and interference, enabling powerful computational advantages.


## Why Do We Need Encoding?
Classical computers use bits (0/1), but quantum computers use qubits (which can be in superpositions like α|0⟩ + β|1⟩).

To leverage quantum speedups (e.g., in machine learning, optimization, or simulation), we must first convert classical data into quantum states.

Different encoding methods are optimized for different tasks (e.g., machine learning vs. cryptography).

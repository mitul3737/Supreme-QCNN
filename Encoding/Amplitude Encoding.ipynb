    "# Amplitude Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude encoding is a technique in quantum computing where classical data (a vector) is encoded into the probability amplitudes of a quantum state. This allows classical data to be represented efficiently in a quantum system, enabling quantum algorithms to process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Store a classical vector in the amplitudes of a quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Idea: A normalized classical vector becomes the coefficients (amplitudes) of a quantum superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: An n-qubit system can represent a 2ⁿ-dimensional vector, offering exponential compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical vector, x=[x0,x1,.........,xN-1] where N=2^n (for n qubits)\n",
    "Example, for 2 qubits, the input will have a length of 2^2=4 . \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have 2 qubits, we do have state [|00> , |01>, |10>, |11>]  and if we want to present only |00> and |11> using this [1,0,0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the vector must be normalized and we will get it's amplitude form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: [1, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Norm: root(1^2+0^2+0^2+1^2)=root(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "​Normalized: [1/√2, 0, 0, 1/√2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If measured, the probabilities of observing each basis state are:\n",
    "P(∣00⟩)=(1/2)^2 =0.5\n",
    "P(∣01⟩)=(0)^2 =0\n",
    "P(∣10⟩)=(0)^2 =0\n",
    "P(∣11⟩)=(1/2)^2 =0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the output should look like [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5]\n"
